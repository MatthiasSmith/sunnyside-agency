### What I learned

For this project, I wanted to try out using Tailwind CSS. I decided to build the page twice so that I could really get a feel for how much time Tailwind might save me. So I first built the site using just HTML/CSS and a tiny amount of JS for the mobile nav menu, and I used the BEM naming convention for styling. Then I built it again but tried to use only Tailwind for styling.

Tailwind surprised me here. I've already used other CSS libraries and often use a few of my own utility-first CSS classes in projects to remain DRY. But the extent to which I only needed to add a few custom CSS snippets to specific things like the "Learn More" link's colored underlines blew me away. Add to that the fact that there were no opinions about how I should structure my HTML (looking at you Bootstrap) made using this CSS library feel like a breath of fresh air.

Tailwind's documentation is also really great. It's to the point and easily searchable. I was able to find everything I needed within seconds.

I would happily use Tailwind again with other similar projects and look forward to seeing how much time I might save from repeatedly writing utility classes for each project.
