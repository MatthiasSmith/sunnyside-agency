## My process
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS-in-JS
- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) - for static site generation
- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) - to build quick and reusable components
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - to add utility first styles
- [styled-jsx](https://github.com/vercel/styled-jsx) - for specific styles not in Tailwind
- [react-scrollmagic](https://github.com/bitworking/react-scrollmagic) - to trigger animation classes as the user scrolls the page

### What I learned

For this project, I wanted to try out using Tailwind CSS. I decided to build the page twice so that I could really get a feel for how much time Tailwind might save me. So I first built the site using just HTML/CSS and a tiny amount of JS for the mobile nav menu, and I used the BEM naming convention for styling. Then I built it again but tried to use only Tailwind for styling.

Tailwind surprised me.

I've used other CSS libraries in the past, but these days I usually write my own CSS â€” often creating a few of my own utility-first CSS classes to help keep my projects [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself).

What blew me away here, was the extent to which I only needed to add a few custom CSS snippets to create application specific things like the "Learn More" links. Add to that the fact that there were no opinions about how I should structure my HTML (Bootstrap ðŸ‘€) made using this CSS library feel like a breath of fresh air.

Tailwind's documentation is also really great. It's to the point and easily searchable. I was able to find everything I needed within seconds.

And yes, in the end, using Tailwind saved me time â€” even though I was learning as I went. I'm looking forward to see how much time it could save me from the start of a project after having gotten myself familiar with it.
